        "q": "What results can I expect and in what timeframe?",
        "a": "With Google Ads you can see impact from the first week (traffic and leads). On social media, growth is progressive: reach and engagement in 2–4 weeks and conversions as the community and paid media consolidate. We report clear metrics (leads, CPA, ROAS)."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need a dedicated landing page for ads?",

      },
      {
        "q": "What is the minimum suggested budget for Google Ads?",

      {
        "q": "How do you measure conversions and ROI?",

        "q": "What does social media management include?",

        "q": "Can you work with my current website?",
